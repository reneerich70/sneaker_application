PURP: create a basic web application using basic html/css Bootstrapv3.7
Title: Sneaker_Application

#I built this application as an assignment from a simple design comp used during the Iron Yard Charleston Front-End Foundations Course.
#It was a basic HML/CSS project that I used with Bootstrap to simplify the responsiveness of the application. 
#The navigation area includes a logo-image with a clickable business name function(I did not include a reference page)
#It also includes a drop-down menu(for mobile devices), search bar, clickable contact button, and a shopping cart.
#The top section is a container with clickable links(no additional pages were added)
#Middle section includes a generic shoe size chart button that links to another page(recreated on a separate page using HTML/CSS)
#3-image carousel added using glyphicon symbols for the chevron prev and next icons(http://glyphicons.com)
#basic footer with link(no additional page added)
